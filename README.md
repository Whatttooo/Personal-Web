# Personal-Web
Here I am designing concepts for a Personal Website about me. I will be posting new code and wireframes regularly. 
The site should be live when all the code runs smoothly. Will hopefully be hosted through GitPages!

Currently coding the HTML and CSS as well as designing a form for people to email me directly from the site.
